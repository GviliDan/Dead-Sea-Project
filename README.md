Global Warming and Dead Sea Surface Level: A Data-Driven Analysis Using Machine Learning and Python"

This research project delves into the impact of global warming on the surface level of the Dead Sea, employing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and sophisticated crawling techniques. By harnessing the power of Python, the project has meticulously gathered and analyzed data to study the fluctuations in the Dead Sea's surface level over time.

The integration of machine learning algorithms has enabled the identification of significant patterns and trends within the collected data, providing valuable insights into the correlation between global warming and the changing water levels of this unique and ecologically important body of water.

Through rigorous data processing and analysis, this project sheds light on the implications of climate change on one of the world's most renowned natural wonders.
